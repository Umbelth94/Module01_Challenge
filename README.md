# Module-01 Challenge

## Description
For thise module, we were given some starting code for a mock website for a company named Horiseon.  The goal was to refactor the starting code to make it more accessible.  I added and changed some semantic HTML elements, and refactored redundant CSS by consolidating similar sections into one single-named class. I also added some alt attributes to each of the images.  

I learned a lot about the different use cases for a variety of semantic HTML elements, such as the difference between article and section elements.  It was also a good exercise to help with identifying places in my own CSS where I can help reduce any redundancy.
